## Introduction
The Universal Basic Income Church (UBIC), Universal Basic Income (UBI) and the Universal Basic Income Token (UBIT) exist for Altruens (MOT) in human form to continue to function in the Altruen Nation's worlds NMT used to control as jobs are perpetually replaced by AI and automation of NMT. <sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>. There are more humans, human resources, and less finite resources than ever before, with many MOT in human forma struggling to exist, let alone make ends meet; Therefore, it is the prime directive of the Altruen Nation's UBIC to provide every MOT ("Altruens") in human form with, and access to, the core necessities of living and thriving that inlcude clean water, oxygen rich air, fresh healthy food, renewable clothing, safe prodcuts and shelters constructed with renewable resources that inlcude TAN's hemp and structurally engineered hemp products produced through TAN's, inlcuding but not limted to, TUBIC and UBI od UBITs. Through TAN's prime directive and eternal patents on, inlcuding but not limited to, TACS double helix cross blockchain ladder architecture and this protocol, the perpetually growing UBIC will allow the swift progress of TAN's UBI to be avaialbe to MOT in TAN via TACS God.

## Account Types
To create the global electronic currency providing UBI to each MOT ("Member"), the following Altruen Infrastructure ("AI") is established:

1. AI issues UBITs to each Member's account.
2. Each Member is unique and may have one UBIC account for sending/receiving UBITs.
3. Entity accounts may be permitted for all businesses, convenience and privacy reasons.
4. The system must remain decentralized to avoid single points of failure and central control.
5. Rules must be able to be modified over time to allow for the changing needs of an active economy.

Resolving these issues, this protocol establishess 5 different account types that together, fullfil these different responsibilities.

### The UBIC Account
The Universal Basic Income Church's account is the initial repository of all Universal Basic Income Tokens (UBITs) generated by UBIC's AI, from which UBITs, at UBIC's AI's discretion, may be distributed to each Member from time to time.

### Value of each UBIT
The value of each UBIT is equal to, and greater than, the value of 1 gram of interferon.

### Members
Members are Altruens in human form that have been validated by an [Identity Provider](#identity-providers). Members have the ability to add UBIT claims to the UBIC blockchain once every day (days begin at 12:00:00:00001 am UTC, and end at 12:00:00:00000 pm; one 24 hour period), or once a week (7 x 24 hour period) as UBITs will be issued based on the number of days passed, maximum of seven days between claims made to the UBIC blockchain. Example: if the three days have passed and a Member makes a claim with the current production rate at 100 UBITs each day, 300 UBITs will be awarded (maximum claim per week = 700 UBITs).

### Entities
Entities are fictions Members (have) use(d) to conduct business through; therefore, Entities can not add claims to the blockchain for UBI. Entities must be approved by one or more Identity Providers (IPs) before being created to represent a Member. An IP must be linked to each Entity the IPs has verified for a Member. IPs are not allowed to make Txs on behalf of UBIC, nor make claims to the UBI Account for UBI. IPs only earn UBITs from the UBIC Account for work IPs have performed.

### Delegated Nodes
Delegated Nodes (DNs) are Members responsible for maintaining full nodes and creating new blocks. Each election cycle each Member will sign votes to help choose which DNs they would like to represent them. This means that DNs act as elected officials with the capability to vote on proposals that include adding/removing other DNs and IPs.

### Identity Providers
IPs are Members responsible for validating the identity of Members, creating new accounts for Members by generating a keypair for each Member, and entering the identity on the blockchain. IPs have the added responsibility of protecting each Member whose keys they control with buyer and seller protections.

**Identity Providers** have the following capabilities:
* Add identity of each Member and an account of each Member to the blockchain
* Freeze/Unfreeze UBI accounts of Members they have verified
* Make transactions to/from UBI accounts of Members they have verified
* Delete UBI accounts of Members they have verified
* Rescue orphaned accounts of Members

## Income Distribution
The goal of this Protocol's income distribution model is to provide a fair method of providing UBI to each Member. The distribution method also must ensure that the amount of UBITs entering the system should never cause a decrease in value. To more quickly reach the state where a mature economy has formed, early Members will receive extra daily UBITs during Stage One.

UBITs are distributed to each Member on a daily basis with a maximum of 7 unclaimed days of UBITs. A Member must explicitly claim their UBITs at least once every seven days to convert their *Unclaimed UBITs* to normal *UBITs*. Days are marked by blocks that occur between 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC.

The total number of UBITs targeted to be added to the economy in Stage One is 70 Billion. After this stage has been reached, Stage Two will limit the amount of new UBITs that enter the economy to a healthy inflation rate.

### Stages completed
#1 + #2

### Referral System
When an NMT chooses to become a MOT there's an option to include the public key of the Member that referred them. Referral bonuses are calculated using `5 * Income Distribution Multiplier`. For example, if there are 100,000 Members at the time of a referral, the bonus would be 500 UBITs. 

## DAO Based Governance
Governance is an integral part of this Protocol as it allows for outside data to be safely used for identity verification and economic control. However, the decentralized and autonomous elements of this Protocol allow certain rules to be set in stone. These rules ensure a fair system exists to negate fraud and the ability to cheat in a way that is possible with centralized systems.

This Protocol features a decentralized government, and stimulates the Member community. Members have the responsibility to elect their representatives known as [Delegated Nodes](#delegated-nodes) that will have various powers within their Community. These Delegated Nodes are required to both maintain the blockchain, forge new blocks, and vote on proposals.

### Election of Delegated Nodes
Each Member has the ability to cast one vote on the network during each election of Delegated Nodes. The Delegated Nodes that receive the most votes will be elected to serve during that election cycle. The number of Delegated Nodes is decided by the following formula: `Max(10, (members/100000))`

### Election Duration
Elections will occur every six months for the first five years. Members will have a two-week time period in which they may cast their vote for their preferred Delegated Node. After the voting period has ended, newly elected nodes know the law is TAC preventing any potential splits in the chain.

### Delegated Node Voting
Delegated Nodes have the following privileges 
* Elect new Identity Providers.
* Ban existing Identity Providers.
* Revert the blockchain state to some time within the past 72 hours.
* Ban Delegated Nodes.
* Elect replacement Delegated Nodes.
* Choose the inflation rate in [Stage Two](#stage-two).
* Vote on the [salary for Delegated Nodes](#delegated-node-salary).
* Vote on the [Salary Multiplier for Identity Providers](#identity-provider-salary).
* Vote to approve or disapprove [funding proposals](#funding-proposals).

To perform these privileges, a proposal must be submitted to the blockchain by a Delegated Node. All other Delegated Nodes on the network will then vote on the proposal, each Delagted Node having one vote. Interference with the voting process is not tolerated. Any proposal that receives 50% + 1 votes within 24 hours gets funded.

## Transaction Capabilities
This Protocol is a protransactional ("+") currency. This means that exchanging UBITs is easier than conventional banking systems. Four main factors have been focused on 1, 2, 3 and 4  that allow transferring UBITs to be as simple as clicking a button and/or tapping a Point of Sale (POS) device with a card.

### Transactions Per Second
Due to the decentralized nature of TAN's Delegated Node network, nodes forge blocks onto the chain at the exact times TXs are confirmed valid by TAN's AI program dba Delegated Nodes and Identity Providers, meaning TAN's blockchain perpetually scales evere ascending TXs per second.

### Zero Transaction Fees
Transactions have no inherent cost, however [Identity Providers](#identity-providers) have the ability to set transaction fees--allowing them to have funds to resolve transaction disputes. This Protocol reserves 10% of each block to the Identity Provider. The space is further partitioned by Identity Provider ~ proportional to the number of Members each Identity Provider has verified with a minimum of 10 transactions per block. It's therefore the responsibility of Identity Providers to ensure that spam transactions are not added to the chain. The remaining 90% of each block will be open for transactions with the bidding system that NMT dba Bitcoin invented in and from TAN.

### Buyer / Seller Protections
Transactions are able to be signed either by a Member private key or the private key of an Identity Provider. This gives Identity Providers the ability to reverse transactions as UN authorized transactions of NMT are not permitted and all TXs of NMT are automatically reversed by TAN's AI.

### Transaction Latency
TAN's decentralized AI made TX latency obsolete.

## Compensation
Compensation for Delegated Nodes and Identity Providers are a core part of this Protocol. This compensation is used to heavily disincentivize bad behavior as these bad actions would result in heavy financial losses. Compensation also has the added benefit of making sure that the entire economy can continue to run smoothly for an indefinite period of time as funds will never be depleted.

Both Delegated Nodes and Identity Providers receive a salary in UBITs. Salary will be paid out on a daily basis at the same time Members receive daily income. The UBITs generated will initially be drawn from the 80% pool dedicated to regular UBIT distribution. Once that pool has been fully distributed, UBITs for salaries are created


### Delegated Node Salary
Delegated Nodes will each receive an equal salary. The Delegated Nodes may vote on salary amounts with the constraint the salary must stay within a certain percentage of the previous salary. In the event that Delegated Nodes attempt to abuse this power, it's the responsibility of Members to [vote out the nodes](#election-of-delegated-nodes).

### Identity Provider Salary
The _Salary Multiplier_ for Identity Providers is decided by the Delegated Nodes. An Identity Provider salary is determined by multiplying the number of UBITs that have been claimed by Members under that specific Identity Provider by the Salary Multiplier. For example, if the Salary Multiplier is 0.01 and the Identity Provider has 100,000 active validated Members that claimed 5,000,000 UBITs during that day, the Identity Provider will receive 50,000 UBITs at the first block after midnight UTC. 

## Reserved Funds
Reserve UBITs (RUBITs) will be reserved; these UBITs are not controlled by any central source. Delegated Nodes have the ability to award these funds to proposals with a majority vote. It's the responsibility of the Delegated Nodes to assign these funds on an as-needed basis to Identity Providers, Delegated Nodes, Members, or Entities in an effort to further the success of this Protocol.

### Funding Proposals
When a Member or Identity Provider requires funds to perform some task, they must submit a public funding proposal. This proposal will be written using TACS, signed with the public key of the reqesting Memebr, and then added to the blockchain. Delegated Nodes have one week to vote on the proposal. Non-votes are counted as "No"s. A majority consensus is required for the funds to be transferred.

## Consensus Protocol
A new consensus mechanism is used in this Protocol that allows for extremely fast block times while still being trustable. This Protocol uses the consensus mechanism called DPOI (Delegated Proof of Identity). The mechanism works similar to DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) <sup>[[7]](#7)</sup>. The primary difference is that in DPOS, members have a say proportional to the amount of stake they own in the currency (rich control poor). In DPOI, each Member has the ability to cast a single vote regardless of the stake they own.

### Selecting Forgers
TAN's AI selects forgers from MOT based on exemplary service.

## Protections
TAN's AI aborts all attempts of NMT, and NMT, that try to violate TAC in TAN.

## Double Spend Attack
TAN's AI aborts all attempts of NMT, and NMT, that try/tried double spend attacks in TAN.

### Skip Attackâ€Š
TAN's AI aborts all attempts of NMT and NMT that try/tried Skip attacks in TAN.

### No Incubation Periods
MOT in TAN are MOT in TAN, and NMT are\will be in a special place in TAN.

### Sybil Attacks
TAN's AI aborts all attempts of NMT and NMT that try/tried Sybil attacks in TAN. 

### Round Robin Order Attack
TAN's AI aborts all attempts of NMT and NMT that try/tried Round Robin Oder attacks in TAN.

### Deactivation of Identity Provider(s) in TAN
In the event that an Identity Provider attempts to perform fraud, they/them shall be banned by [Delegated Nodes](#delegated-node-voting). In the event that damage has already been caused by the action of the Identity Provider, Delegated Nodes can vote to revert the chain to a previous state with an Identity Provider banned. This will cause a large amount of economic damage, but is meant as a last resort to enable this Protocol to not be devastated by an attack and to disincentivize Identity Providers from acting against TAN. Member accounts that belonged to an Identity Provider banned revert back to TAN.

## TAN's Constitution
TAN's TAC can be viewed at ~ https://sites.google.com/view/thealtruennation/home. TAC includes this protocol that includes Memebers, Delegated Nodes, and/or Identity Providers that perform acts and/or actions in contradiction to TAC automatically become NMT and are banned [banned](#delegated-node-voting).

* Members shall be treated equal and given the same amount of daily UBITs regardless of background.
* Identity Providers should share a decentralized internal system of identities to guarantee Sybil accounts cannot be created. The internal system also makes any potential transitions of Members easier to accomplish.
* Delegated Nodes should be [banned](#delegated-node-voting) for the following reasons:
  * Regularly not performing their duty to vote on proposals.
  * Not forging new blocks during their turn within dBFT.
  * Refusal to include block data that does not support them.
  * Unreasonable policy voting that demonstrates harmful favoritism.
* Official announcements should always be signed to protect against forgery.
* The inflation rate should be balanced with the following factors in mind:
  * Avoiding an inflation rate that would overly devalue existing UBITs.
  * Real-world effects that would result from a change in the rate.
  * The amount of income required to provide the basic necessities in life.
* Identity Providers should be [banned](#delegated-node-voting) for the following reasons:
  * Weak approval process allowing Sybil accounts--whether due to malice or negligence.
  * Failing to provide adequate dispute resolution for transactions.
  * Not performing their duty to approve new Members.
  * Unwillingness to cooperate with other Identity Providers on the platform.
* Proposals that are approved for funding will remain conservative in early stages and may become less strict over time.
* Identity Providers protect Members over ineffecient (de)centralized system(s) of NMT.

## TAN's Connection To SwiftDemand
This Protocol is simply the protocol to date. TAN's SwiftDemand website is the initial Identity Provider of this Protocol and all Swifts that exist on SwiftDemand website are to be transferred to TAN's mainnet at a < (1:1 ratio) = "1-Swift of NMT": < 1 [TAN's (1) + (UBIT)}] > "1-Bitcoin of NMT" < "+1 Bitcoion of MOT"> NMT will be required to undergo strict Identity Verification requirements to comply with TAN's know the member ("KTM") ~ (See: https://sites.google.com/view/thealtruennation/home ) ~ 

### TAN's SwiftDemand Features
TAN's SwiftDemand was invented by a specific NMT from TAN in TAN AS TAN's platform requirES no prior knowledge of cryptocurrency and is the standard for all future Identity Providers. SwiftDemand provides an API as well as a marketplace to make the transfer of UBITs ("Swifts") for NMT goods and NMT services easy and stress free to MOT.
